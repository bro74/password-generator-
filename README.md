# password-generator-

## Description 

This challenge was an **On-the-job ticket** or **feature request Challenges** that gave a wonky starter code for a landing page to modify. The user was an employee that wanted to generate random passwords based on a critera so that they can create a password with strong security. I followed the acceptance criteria to modify the mockup. Since this is challenge number 3, I was familiar with a feautre request challenge. Though, I it took some time to understand the meaning behind a for loop. I am slowllly getting this.
